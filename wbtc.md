WBTC is a type of token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin and can be used in Ethereum smart contracts just like any other ERC-20 token.

The process of "wrapping" Bitcoin involves locking up Bitcoin in exchange for an equivalent amount of WBTC, which can then be transferred to the Ethereum network. This allows Bitcoin holders to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem without having to sell their Bitcoin holdings.
It means they are eagerly anticipating the arrival of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network in the form of WBTC. This may be because they want to use WBTC to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or other Ethereum-based projects.
